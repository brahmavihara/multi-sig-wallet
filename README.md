## First public repo project

<p>practicing with eattheblocks</p>

<p>maybe showcase to portfolio on gitcoin</p>

### Merits of uploading to github

1. Public mindset
2. Be easier to reference back in my own brain.

<p>Definitely need to review all of this too</p>

<p>Use Next.js if can, make the styling design decent.</p>

<p>user mindset</p>

<p>Actually using UI may help to visualize better</p>

### To install

<p>npm i (code snippet markdown)</p>

#### Memo to self

<p>Need more work here</p>

#### Future improvements

- Deploy to Mumbai testnet
- Deploy to Polygon mainnet
- or use BSC/xDai/etc
- Other like functions and styling too if can.
